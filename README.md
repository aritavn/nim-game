# Nim Game

Nim is a game for 2 players. Given a heap of 13 matches, on every move, a player must take 1, 2 or 3 matches from the heap, until no matches are left. The player who draws the last match loses. There are many variations of the Nim game, this one is called mis√®re game (on one row or heap).

For the moves done by the computer the number of matches taken by the computer can be chosen randomly. Of course, it must not exceed the number of available matches, e.g. if there are only two matches left the computer can only take one or two matches.
